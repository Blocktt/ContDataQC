-   Offset time collections (e.g., Air and Water data in same file but not starting at the same time). Fixed fun.QC.R(fun.QC() and fun.CalcQCStats()) to account for this disparity. Previous iteration flagged every other row. Rows without data are no longer flagged (unless the data at the regular time interval was missing). 20170512.

-   Applied fix from fun.QC.R for difftime to report markdown files; Report\_Aggregate.RMD, Report\_Stats.RMD, and Report\_QC.RMD.. 20170512.
