<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The ContDataQC Shiny app is a free R-based tool to QC, combine, and summarize continuous data files in a standardized way without having to download any programs to your computer. It also has a function that allows users to download USGS gage data for desired time periods. The table at the bottom of this page shows how the website is structured.</p>
<p>To date, ContDataQC has been used primarily on continuous temperature and hydrologic data but can also be used for conductivity, pH, turbidity and chlorophyll-a. Users can add other parameters as well but this requires more advanced R skills.</p>
<p>This Shiny app is linked to the ContDataQC R package, which was developed by Erik W. Leppo from Tetra Tech (<a href="mailto:Erik.Leppo@tetratech.com" class="email">Erik.Leppo@tetratech.com</a>) and is available on <a href="https://github.com/leppott/ContDataQC">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Development of the ContDataQC R tools has been funded by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) as part of a larger project to establish Regional Monitoring Networks (RMNs) for freshwater streams and inland lakes (USEPA 2016, USEPA 2021; lead EPA scientist: Britta Bierwagen). The RMNs are a volunteer, collaborative effort in which entities collect long-term continuous temperature and hydrologic data at targeted sites to detect changes over time. The R package and Shiny app were developed with the following objectives in mind: ensure that a certain (minimum) level of QC is being performed on the continuous RMN data; standardize and speed up data QC and reduce missed errors; standardize data for further analysis; and facilitate data sharing.</p>
