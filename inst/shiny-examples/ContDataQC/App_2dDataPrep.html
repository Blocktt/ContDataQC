<p>Below are examples of what HOBO U20 CSV files look like before and after they are run through the reformat function. The reformat function does the following -</p>
<ul>
<li>Changes column headings as needed</li>
<li>Creates a new ‘SiteID’ column and populates it with the SiteID that it takes from the first part of the input file name (the SiteID should precede the first underscore in the file name)</li>
<li>Creates RowID columns for air and water sensors</li>
<li>Creates LoggerID fields for air and water sensors based on the LGR S/N entries in the column headings</li>
<li>Removes the first row (Plot Title)</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is a problem with the input file, the screen will turn gray and it will say ‘disconnected from the server’ in the lower left.</p>
</div>
<div id="common-errors--" class="section level2">
<h2>Common errors -</h2>
<ul>
<li>‘logged’ text entries in the bottom row of the CSV (these occur if you forget to uncheck the ‘select internal logger events to plot’ boxes during Plot SetUp)</li>
<li>Two serial numbers in the column heading (you should only have one S/N; make sure under Preferences-Export settings, you only have the ‘include logger serial number’ box checked, NOT the ‘include sensor serial number or label if available’ box)</li>
</ul>
