<h1>Organizing Files</h1>
<p>Not everyone has access to software and data management systems that can accommodate continuous data and even if you do, there are files that will not be uploaded to the data management system that are important to retain (such as the original sensor files and field forms).</p>
<p>If you don’t have a good file organization scheme, we recommend setting up folders as shown below as a starting point. Folders and files can be customized as you gain more experience. The files should be backed up regularly and accessible to other members of your data management team.</p>
<p>Click <a href="https://github.com/leppott/ContDataQC/tree/dev_shinymods/Documents/Organizing_Files">here</a> to download a zipped file with a ready-made set of (empty) folders. Simply put the file in the desired location, unzip it and then replace ‘SiteX’ with the appropriate site name.</p>
<p>The Shiny app allows for more flexibility with the folder scheme than the R package. For example, you don’t need to name the folders exactly as shown below because you can browse to the desired input files and browse to save the output files to the desired location. However, if you decide to use the R package at some point, keeping the four ‘Data’ folders (Data0_Original, Data1_RAW, Data2_QC, Data3_Aggregated and Data4_Stats) will be important since the R code looks for and outputs files to these directories (although advanced R users can modify these default directories if desired). If you use the folder scheme below, it will give you more flexibility to go back and forth between using the R package and Shiny app.</p>

<td style="text-align:left;">
For files that are exported out of the sensor software (like HOBOWare) that need to be reformatted before they can be run through the ContDataQC R package.

<td style="text-align:left;">
For formatted .csv files that are ready to run through the QC function.

Data2_QC
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
After you run the QC function, put the QC reports into this folder. Make corrections to the .csv QC files as needed. When you run the Aggregate function, you will use the QC’d data files from this folder.

Data3_Aggregated

<td style="text-align:left;">
After you run the Aggregate function to combine the QC’d data files, put the output files into this folder. When you run the SummaryStats function, you will use the aggregated data files from this folder.

<td style="text-align:left;">
After you run the SummaryStats function, put the output files into this folder.

FieldForms
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Observations from site visits are very important for the QC process as they can provide clues as to why erroneous measurements or changes may have occurred (e.g., had to move sensor, sensor out of water, sensor buried in sediment, vandalism).
</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
in_situ
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
An important QC check (which we call an ‘accuracy check’) involves comparing in situ measurements taken during site visits to the closest sensor measurement(s). We ask that RMN partners keep an accuracy check worksheet in this folder<a href="https://github.com/leppott/ContDataQC/tree/dev_shinymods/Documents/Organizing_Files">(click here to download an example worksheet).</a>
</td>

<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
orig
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
If you are overrun with raw files that are not named consistently and are poorly organized (for example, sometimes files are saved multiple times with different names and in different folders), RMN partners have found it helpful to put all the raw files for a site into one folder, inventory what they have, and then sort them into the appropriate folders.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Photos
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
RMN protocols call for taking photos from the same locations during each site visit. Photographs are important for relocating the sensors and documenting changes to the monitoring location.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
R_ConfigurationFiles
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Creating a customized configuration file (or files) for a site allows you to adjust QC test thresholds, make changes to units and plot labels, and more. Under the ‘QC Thresholds’ tab, you can upload a customized configuration file. If the file is stored in this folder, it will be easy to find. The customized file needs to be uploaded before running the QC function, otherwise the default settings will be used.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
SensorFile
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
We recommend retaining original sensor files in case you need to go back and regenerate certain data (e.g., with HOBO sensors, sometimes people go back and rerun sensor depth with reference water level measurements). In some situations, it may be helpful to add subfolders for each sensor type (for example, with lakes, there may be many temperature files mixed in with DO and water level files; in these cases, it may be easier to find files if you create subfolders for temperature, DO and water level).
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
USGSgage
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
If there is a nearby, representative USGS gage, we recommend comparing your sensor data to the USGS gage data as an additional QC check.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
WxStation
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
If there is a nearby, representative weather station, we recommend comparing your sensor data to the weather station data as an additional QC check.
